Practice with lambda create a function in 2 different languages. They should be linked to an API that takes a number and does some math with it and returns the result. For example function multByTwo(inputNum){ return inputNum *2}
this will get called from a web page text box. the first one in python second one in javascript.
also look into debugging lamda functions locally with VS code

step 1: create web page. do the function locally with .js file
step 2: create lamda functions and test the api with postman
step 3: put them on the website and run.
------
added some front end input validation to the textbox require that it is a number and doesn't overflow
back end validation added to lambda function make sure its a number and doesnt overflow put string
to number conversion in try catch.
